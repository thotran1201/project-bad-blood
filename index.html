            “Cause baby, now we've got bad blood. You know it used to be mad love. So, take a look what you've done. Cause baby, now we've got bad blood.”

                Everyone loves the obsession or temptation of retaliating your own worst nemesis. Therefore, it’s addicting and “juicy”, and it can create the major accusations between the opponents, basically the “he said, she said." For example, in my own perspective, my ex-best friend who turns out to be very toxic accused me of lying that I wanted to hang out with the family instead of going hiking with her and her boyfriend from Summer 2021 before Memorial Day. Toxicities is at its finest and it’s the opposite of “tough love.”

                My decision is to create a website that is inspired of my current beef with Jane Doe, utilizing HTML, CSS, and SCSS or SASS languages. It’s called “The Avengers” or "Project Bad Blood", but with celebrities. Just to note there: this is fictional and if those celebrities are feeling offended, I apologized for the misunderstanding but again, this is fictional. Please don’t “@” me or DM me for negative tendencies, verbally. Don’t try to sue me when you see my project. This is for my first assignment I'm doing and I'm creating the website for this project. Also, this website is an absolute perfect revenge on Jane Doe and her boyfriend John Doe to completely scare both of them off. However, both and I are already not cool to each other anytime soon.
